# Diabetic Car Start

## Overview
A safety feature incorporating a blood glucose sensor to allow your car to turn on or not.

### Main features

1. Blood glucose monitor is connected via bluetooth or cable to microcontroller.

1. A relay has been implimented into the neutral start line of the car to keep it off if conditions not met.

### Secondary Features

1. Create an online dashboard that interfaces with the blood glucose monitor to display data.

1. Have blood glucose  data displayed to an OLED placed on the dashboard of the vehicle. 
	-Display cooldown for relay if conditions were not met.
	-Display correction if not within proper parimeters 

1. Add LED's to have quick red/green feedback if relay is closed(green) or open(red).

1. CAD Designs
		-Create something to hold the OLED, microcontroller, tiny breadboard, and uSD reader
		-Create something to hold the blood glucose monitor
